		<p style="color: cornsilk">
			Dussehra is celebrated after Navratri because it is believed that Lord
			Ram worshipped Goddess Durga before starting his journey to defeat
			Ravana, on Lord Vishnuâ€™s advice. The festival marks the victory of Lord
			Ram over Lanka king Ravana (the 10-headed demon).<br />

			There are several mythological stories behind this festival. This day in
			some parts of India signifies the day on which Goddess Durga killed the
			demon Mahishasur. That is why all the nine avatars of Goddess Durga are
			worshipped on the Navaratri.

		<p style="color: cornsilk">
			It is also said that Goddess Durga is immersed in water with the
			devotees who signifies the departure of Goddess Durga from the material
			world after maintaining Dharma. In South India, the Dussehra festival
			mainly, in Mysore, Karnataka is celebrated as the day when
			Chamundeshwari, another avatar of Goddess Durga killed the demon
			Mahishasur. Do you know that the entire city is illuminated with
			colourful lights and decorated beautifully? In fact parades of elephants
			that carry processions of Goddess Chamundeshwari were also carried
			throughout the city.
