        <p>
            People of the Hindu faith observe Dussehra through special prayer
            meetings and food offerings to the gods at home or in temples throughout
            India. They also hold outdoor fairs (melas) and large parades with
            effigies of Ravana (a mythical king of ancient Sri Lanka). The effigies
            are burnt on bonfires in the evening. Dussehra is the culmination of the
            Navaratri festival.
