            In various parts of northern India, huge and colourful effigies of Ravana
            and his son Meghanada and brother Kumbhakaran are set on fire in the
            ground or open fields. People participate in the event and enjoy it.
            Dussehra festival is also observed by organising a theatrical enactment of
            life stories of Rama known as Ram Lila. At the end of Durga Puja, people
            celebrate this festival in West Bengal, Bihar, and Odisha. Bengalis sing
            folk songs, immerse the idols of Goddess Durga in water bodies. In
            Himachal Pradesh, the Vijayadashami festival in Kullu has been given the
            status of an International festival by the State Government.
